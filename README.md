# Moby_Land

This publically available package contains all of the custom tools that Adam uses over and over again (in other words, all my boilerplate code). While it is really just a way for me to access my own python concoctions, I welcome anyone to contribute things that they themselves use! Also, please feel free to use any of my gadgets—some of them are rather nifty.

## Installation
The package is publically available through The Python Package Index (PyPI). To download, simply run the following from your command line:

```pip install Moby-Land```

If that gives you issues, try:

```python3.12 -m pip install Moby-Land```

Make sure your package is up to date—because I will be using this for primarily my own work, I may not do the best job of maintaining old versions.

## What does Moby_Land have to offer?
This package currently doesn't have a ton of functionality, but as I go through my career I plan on adding every step of the way. Right now the breakdown is as follows
- `custom_logging/`: Some cool loggers that I like to use.
- `plotting/`: Plot formatting and helper function that help make plots pretty.
- `astro/`: Useful astrophysics functions.

Some things to add in the futureL
- `data_science`: Boiler plate code that I use when doing datascience.
  - Propagating types of error
  - Easy-to-use grid search functionality
- `notes`: A place to keep any notes that I reference frequently.

## What/Who is Moby?
Moby is my dog. Just thought it would be fun to name something after him... He's a very good boy.
